# 🗳️ AMMOcoin DAO Participation Guide

Learn how to participate in AMMOcoin's decentralized governance system, vote on proposals, and help shape the future of the network.

## 🏛️ What is the AMMOcoin DAO?

The **AMMOcoin DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)** is a governance system that allows the community to make decisions about the network's future through democratic voting.

### Key Features

- 💰 **Treasury Management** - Control over development funds
- 🚀 **Development Direction** - Vote on new features
- 🔧 **Network Parameters** - Adjust protocol settings
- 👥 **Decentralized Control** - No single authority

### DAO vs Traditional Governance
| Aspect | Traditional | AMMOcoin DAO |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Decision Making** | Centralized | Decentralized |
| **Voting Power** | Board/CEO | Masternode holders |

           protocolVersion >= MIN_BUDGET_PEER_PROTO_VERSION;
}
```

### Budget Calculations
```cpp
// Monthly budget calculation
CAmount GetBudgetPaymentCycleTotal() {
    CAmount nSubsidy = GetBlockSubsidy(nBestHeight);
    return ((nSubsidy / 100) * 10) * Params().GetBudgetPaymentCycleBlocks();
}
```
